## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have atleast met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Django 5.1.4 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for version control)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayush-github123/Health-Backend.git
    cd HealthcareBackend
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Set up the environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `HealthcareBackend` directory and add the following:
    ```plaintext
    SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
    DEBUG=True
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID='your-google-client-id'
    GOOGLE_SECRET='your-google-secret'
    GEMINI_API_KEY='your-gemini-api-key'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER='your-email'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your-email-password'
    ```

6. **Set up the database:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. **Create a superuser:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to create a superuser account.

8. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The server will start at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

2. **Open the `test.rest` file** in VSCode.
3. **Send requests** by clicking on the "Send Request" links in the `test.rest` file.

The `test.rest` file contains predefined requests for various API endpoints, making it easy to test the functionality of the backend.
